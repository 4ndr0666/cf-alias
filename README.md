## 🚀 Overview

`cf-alias` is a minimalist CLI for **Cloudflare Email Routing** that brings domain alias management into your terminal or Alfred workflow.  
It uses Cloudflare’s *undocumented* routing endpoints — so treat it as an advanced tool for developers comfortable working close to the metal.

Built in **Rust**, deployed via **GoReleaser**, and distributed on the **Arch User Repository (AUR)**.

### Highlights

- 🧩 Manage Cloudflare aliases directly from CLI  
- ⚙️ Integrated Alfred workflow (`alfred/mx.alfredworkflow`)  
- 💥 Zero-config shell completions for Bash, Zsh, and Fish  
- 🔒 100% reproducible builds with signed releases
